Skin: take care of your skin. Use lotion everyday. Exfoliate. Use a lotion meant for your face on your face.

Clothes: research what clothes look flattering on your body type. Research what size you are in womens sizes. If it's an option there is plenty of cute and cheap clothes on Amazon. Plus its discrete.

Shaving: Get your skin really warm before shaving - helps reduce bumps and irritation. You can use nair or veet or something for legs (although test to see if they react to your skin first)




Training

I've received a few requests to simplify the previous posts into one workout. The three best glute maximus exercises (squats, lunges, and glute bridges) and two solid glute medius exercises (fire hydrants and leg abductions). If you've got ankle weights or exercise bands you can make the medius work even more effective. Try this routine 2-3 times per week. If it's too difficult at first, then start at two overall sets of each exercise and then working up to three later. I would also recommending adding 20-30 times minutes of cardio on a regular basis (read: 4-5 times weekly). Cardio is easiest when done in small manageable chunks.

Squats (3x25 bodyweight or 3x12 weighted). Go very low, like thighs parallel with the ground. You should feel it in your butt at the end of the movement.

Lunges (3x25 bodyweight or 3x12 weighted). I do these as a walking lunge series (like walking down a hallway) for more glute activation. You can also try reverse lunges for the same effect. You should feel this more in your butt than thighs.

Glute Bridges (3x25 bodyweight or 3x12 weighted). I'll either do these as single leg bridges and then finish with a double leg set or just use weight to make it harder. Focus on full extension at the top of the bridge for glute activation.
Here's a good example (ignore the band): https://giphy.com/gifs/8fit-fitness-workout-7EeEk7QIUVKbV5RWzn

Fire Hydrants (3x25 bodyweight or 3x12 with ankle weights).

Side Leg Raises or Banded Abductions (3x25). If you're using exercise bands start with a moderate tension and focus on full range of motion.

Core Work. Your choice here. Planks, ab wheel rollouts, pushups, crunches, etc... 3 sets of moderately difficult core work.

Now go build those hips!
