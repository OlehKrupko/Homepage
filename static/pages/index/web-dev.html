The :first-of-type and :last-of-type selectors only operate inside their parent element. That is to say, p:first-of-type selects the first <p> in every container element.

If you wanted to avoid the sidebar paragraphs and select only the first <p> in our <div class='page'>, you would need to limit its scope using a child selector, like so:

.page > p:first-of-type {
  color: #7E8184;
  font-style: italic;
}
